Getting Started with Nextflow
=============================

Tutorial Goals
--------------

-  Learn about `Nextflow <https://www.nextflow.io/>`__
-  Create a basic Nextflow Workflow which uses a Docker image
-  Run the Workflow locally
-  Describe a sample parameterization of the Workflow
-  Push the Workflow onto GitHub

Describe Your Workflow with Nextflow
------------------------------------

.. important::
    Since there is no concept of Nextflow as a tool, we
    will register BAMStats as a workflow. To learn about what a workflow is,
    see :doc:`Getting Started With Dockstore Workflows <dockstore-workflows/>`. Once you
    are done that page then come back here.

Nextflow is a bit different from CWL and WDL. Instead of having one type
of descriptor file, dockstore uses two different kinds of files: A
config file, ``nextflow.config`` and a descriptor file, often,
``main.nf``.

Configuration File
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``nextflow.config`` file is used to store configuration information,
such as Docker image and memory required to run. Below is the config
file for our BAMStats workflow. The config file groups together similar
information and settings within scopes, such as manifest and docker.

::

    manifest {
        description = 'Generate some stats on a BAM file'
        author = 'Andrew Duncan'
    }

    params {
        bam_input = 'rna.SRR948778.bam'
        mem_gb = '4'
    }

    process.container = 'quay.io/collaboratory/dockstore-tool-bamstats:1.25-6_1.0'
    docker {
        enabled = true
        docker.runOptions = '-u $(id -u):$(id -g)'
    }

The manifest scope includes high level information about the tool. In
this case we have a description of the tool and the author name. Note
that we use the author and description fields to populate metadata on
Dockstore.

.. note:: If no description is defined in the descriptor file, the
          README from the corresponding Git repository is used.

::

    manifest {
        description = 'Generate some stats on a BAM file'
        author = 'Andrew Duncan'
    }

The next section is the params section. Here we define parameters
required by our workflow, including the memory in GB needed and the path
to the input BAM file. Note that we can override these parameters
directly in the ``main.nf`` file, or on the command line using the
format ``--parameter_name parameter_value``.

::

    params {
        bam_input = 'rna.SRR948778.bam'
        mem_gb = '4'
    }

We next define the Docker container used in the process scope. Note that
we do this differently than the other fields. This is another valid
syntax for setting values within a scope.

::

    process.container = 'quay.io/collaboratory/dockstore-tool-bamstats:1.25-6_1.0'

The last scope of the file is the docker scope. This scope does not
define the container that we use, instead it defined other Docker
related configurations. Note that we have to specify that we want Docker
enabled. Just setting the process.container is not enough!

::

    docker {
        enabled = true
        docker.runOptions = '-u $(id -u):$(id -g)'
    }

There are many more scopes and options within the scopes. To learn more
see the `official
documentation <https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/config.html>`__.

Descriptor File
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``main.nf`` is similar to the ``Dockstore.cwl`` and
``Dockstore.wdl`` we used for CWL and WDL respectively. It includes a
description of a tool, including the inputs, outputs, and command run.
Below is the ``main.nf`` file for BAMStats.

::

    #!/usr/bin/env nextflow

    bamFile = file(params.bam_input)

    process bamstats {
        input:
        file bam_input from bamFile
        val mem_gb from params.mem_gb

        output:
        file 'bamstats_report.zip'

        """
        bash /usr/local/bin/bamstats $mem_gb $bam_input
        """
    }

First we tell Nextflow that the bam\_input parameter is a file. We do
this outside of the process.

::

    bamFile = file(params.bam_input)

Next we will look at the process scope. It is made of the input, output
and command sections.

In the input section we define the input bam\_input as a file from the
object bamFile. We also define the input mem\_gb to be the value of the
parameter mem\_gb.

::

    input:
    file bam_input from bamFile
    val mem_gb from params.mem_gb

We then define the output of the process as the file
``bamstats_report.zip``. Note that we do not do anything with this
output. If we were to have a multi process workflow, where another
process depended on this output file, we would have to do more to setup
that connection. However, this is not within the scope of this tutorial.

::

    output:
    file 'bamstats_report.zip'

The final section is the command section. This section defines what
command is run by the process. We run the bamstats command line tool and
pass it the mem\_gb and bam\_input parameters that we define in the
input section of the process.

::

    """
    bash /usr/local/bin/bamstats $mem_gb $bam_input
    """

.. _Testing Nextflow Locally:

Testing Locally
---------------

.. note:: 
    As of 1.5.0 you cannot run Nextflow workflows from the CLI.
    Instead you must run them directly from the Nextflow command line tool.
    The only drawback of this is that it does not support Dockstore file
    provisioning. It does have its own form of file provisioning, but we
    will not go into that here.

So at this point, you’ve created a Docker-based tool and have described
how to call that tool using Nextflow. Let’s test running the BAMStats
using the Nextflow command line and descriptor rather than just directly
calling it via Docker. This will test that the Nextflow correctly
describes how to run your tool.

First thing I’ll do is create a completely local dataset and update the
configuration file:

::

    $> wget ftp://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/phase3/data/NA12878/alignment/NA12878.chrom20.ILLUMINA.bwa.CEU.low_coverage.20121211.bam
    # alternative location if the above URL doesn't work
    $> wget https://s3.amazonaws.com/oconnor-test-bucket/sample-data/NA12878.chrom20.ILLUMINA.bwa.CEU.low_coverage.20121211.bam

This downloads to my current directory. I could choose another location,
it really doesn't matter. We then must update the ``nextflow.config``
with the new file.

::

    manifest {
        description = 'Generate some stats on a BAM file'
        author = 'Andrew Duncan'
    }

    params {
        bam_input = 'NA12878.chrom20.ILLUMINA.bwa.CEU.low_coverage.20121211.bam'
        mem_gb = '4'
    }

    process.container = 'quay.io/collaboratory/dockstore-tool-bamstats:1.25-6_1.0'
    docker {
        enabled = true
        docker.runOptions = '-u $(id -u):$(id -g)'
    }

Now we just need the Nextflow CLI to run the tool. Assuming you have
Java 8+ installed, run the following command to install Nextflow.

::

    curl -s https://get.nextflow.io | bash 

We recommend that you add this command to your PATH so that you can run
it from anywhere.

We can now run the tool with the following command

::

    $> ./nextflow run main.nf
    N E X T F L O W  ~  version 0.31.0
    Launching `main.nf` [voluminous_dubinsky] - revision: 5a7f382891
    [warm up] executor > local
    [c4/6f9ebf] Submitted process > bamstats

The logs for the tool run will be visible in the .nextflow.log file in
the current directory. It specifies the working dir of the tool and
where we can find the output. In our case the output was stored at
``work/c4/6f9ebfe4e2c30d9685cf3cfbbf7643/bamstats_report.zip``.

Adding a Test Parameter File
----------------------------

Nextflow does not have the concept of a test parameter file. Instead you
either pass parameters on the command line when you run it, or you can
specify parameters in the ``nextflow.config`` or ``main.nf``.
