----------------

Major
~~~~~

Workflow IDs now take into account the source control repo that they
were indexed from for example
https://dockstore.org/workflows/github.com/h3abionet/h3agatk is the
proper home of that workflow as opposed to
https://dockstore.org/workflows/h3abionet/h3agatk ### Minor \* can no
longer change tool or workflow name for entries that have already been
created \* can no longer change descriptor type of workflows (unless in
stub mode)
