Migrating Your Existing Workflows to Use GitHub Apps
======================================================

Dockstore 1.9.0 provides users with a way to keep their workflows automatically updated (instead of needing to manually refresh) by using GitHub apps.
Here, we will go over how to migrate your existing Dockstore workflows to use GitHub apps.
This tutorial assumes that you are are familiar with the  ``/.dockstore.yml`` file by having read our overview of :doc:`GitHub apps </getting-started/github-apps>`. and the :ref:`Registration With GitHub Apps` section in our workflow registration document.

GitHub App Installation
-----------------------

The first step to migrating a workflow is the same as adding a new workflow via GitHub apps: install our Dockstore GitHub app onto your repository or
organization. You do this by navigating to ``/my-workflows``, clicking the ``+`` button on the left hand sidebar, selecting ``Register using GitHub Apps``, and then clicking
``+ Manage Dockstore Installation on GitHub``. You'll then be redirected to GitHub where you can select which repositories can be accessed by the GitHub app.

Creating a .dockstore.yml File
-------------------------------

Once the GitHub app is installed on the correct repo, the next step is to create a ``/.dockstore.yml`` file. We'll cover a very straigtforward example
first, but depending on how you configured the workflow during registration and whether your GitHub repository houses multiple workflows published on Dockstore,
there will be additional steps to writing your ``/.dockstore.yml`` file.

Let's say we have the following CWL workflow registered on Dockstore that came from this `repository <https://github.com/NatalieEO/ghapps-single-workflow>`__ and you would like to convert the master branch.

   :alt: Workflow to Migrate

As noted in our other documentation, create a ``/.dockstore.yml`` file in the root directory of the branch you want to migrate (in this example, it's the master branch) in your repository. The file should look like the following

.. code:: yaml

   version: 1.2
   workflows:
      - subclass: CWL
        primaryDescriptorPath: /Dockstore.cwl
        testParameterFiles:
            - /test/dockstore.cwl.json

The information above was filled out using the following:

- ``subclass`` is taken from the ``Descriptor Type``
- ``primaryDescriptorPath`` is from ``Workflow Path``
- ``testParameterFiles`` is from ``Test File Path``

During the original registration for your workflow, you may have filled out the ``Workflow Name`` field shown in the picture below.

.. figure:: /assets/images/docs/workflow-name-field.png
   :alt: Workflow to Migrate
   :width: 60 %

This field is required when you want to register multiple workflows from the same repo, but you may have filled it out for other reasons. To check if the workflow
you want to migrate has a workflow name set, select the workflow and look at the title on top as shown in the picture below.

The title consists of:
``<sourceControl>/<organization name>/<repository name>/<optional workflow name>:<version name>``

If you see a workflow name inserted, you must include the name field in your ``/.dockstore.yml``.

.. code:: yaml

   version: 1.2
   workflows:
      - subclass: CWL
        primaryDescriptorPath: /Dockstore.cwl
        testParameterFiles:
            - /test/dockstore.cwl.json
        name: optional-name

If you have multiple workflows registered on Dockstore that stem from the same GitHub repo, a single ``/.dockstore.yml`` can be used to convert them.
Again, you need to check for the Workflow Name field being set because it's need for multi workflow repositories.
If the name field in the ``dockstore.yml`` doesn't match the Workflow Name field in Dockstore, the migration of your workflow on Dockstore will not go through and it will instead create a new Dockstore entry.
Let's say we want to convert these two workflows that come from this `repository <https://github.com/NatalieEO/ghapps-single-workflow>`__.

.. image:: /assets/images/docs/github-apps-multiple-workflows.png

.. image:: /assets/images/docs/github-apps-multiple-workflows-with-name.png

Your ``/.dockstore.yml`` would look like the following:

.. code:: yaml

   version: 1.2
   workflows:
      - subclass: CWL
        primaryDescriptorPath: /Dockstore.cwl
        testParameterFiles:
            - /test/dockstore.cwl.json
      - subclass: WDL
        primaryDescriptorPath: /Dockstore.wdl
        testParameterFiles:
            - /test/dockstore.wdl.json
        name: optional-name

Testing the Migration
----------------------

.. note:: Push events will only be captured by Dockstore **after** installing the GitHub app onto the repo.

To test out your GitHub app integration, make a push to a branch. Navigate to or refresh your browser on the My Workflows page, and select the workflow you wanted to convert.
You should see that the ``Workflow Information`` section looks a bit different.

.. image:: /assets/images/docs/workflow-information-after-migration.png

It now lists the mode as ``DOCKSTORE_YML`` instead of ``FULL`` and information about paths is no longer included.
You are also no longer able to refresh or restub the workflow any more. Since you can't refresh the entire workflow anymore, **new** versions from GitHub (releases/branches) that you want to add to Dockstore must have a ``DOCKSTORE_YML``.
However, you can still refresh already existing versions/branches on Dockstore that you haven't converted by going to the Versions tab, clicking Actions, and selecting Refresh Version.
