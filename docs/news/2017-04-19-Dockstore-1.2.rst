Dockstore 1.2 Release
=====================
*April 19, 2017*

`The latest Dockstore major release <https://github.com/dockstore/dockstore/releases/tag/1.2.0>`_ includes a large number of new features and fixes. A subset of highlighted new features follows.

Highlighted New Features
------------------------

-  Support for private tools
-  users can register tools where users will need to ask the original
   author for access
-  Support for
   `private <https://dockstore.org/docs/docker_registries>`__ Docker
   images hosted in GitLab and Amazon ECR
-  Allow users to star tools and workflows
-  Stargazers page to show all users who have starred a particular tool
   or workflow
-  Support for `file provisioning
   plugins <https://github.com/dockstore/dockstore-cli/tree/master/dockstore-file-plugin-parent>`__
-  Better error messaging passed along from a newer cwltool version
-  Compatibility with a Write API service for programmatically adding
   tools

Breaking Changes
----------------

-  The default Dockstore install no longer includes S3 support. Instead,
   S3 support is provided by a plugin that can be installed via
   ``dockstore plugin download``
-  The command ``dockstore tool launch`` used to use ``--local-entry``
   as a flag to indicate that ``--entry`` was pointing at a local file.
   Now, it replaces ``--entry``. i.e. use
   ``dockstore tool launch --local-entry <your local file>`` rather than
   ``dockstore tool launch --local-entry --entry <your local file>``
-  Update your cwltool install, details in the onboarding wizard
