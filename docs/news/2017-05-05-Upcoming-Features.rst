Upcoming Features
=================
*May 5, 2017*

To give you a taste of what we're working on for the next major version
of Dockstore, we're looking at features in the following main areas:

-  Searching!
-  As Dockstore grows, we've noticed that our current solution for
   searching tools (go to `Tools <https://dockstore.org/tools>`__ or
   `Workflows <https://dockstore.org/workflows>`__ and type in the
   search box) is becoming less useful. Look for more useful ways to
   search and filter tools and workflows in the next version
-  More ways to launch tools and workflows
-  We're working with partners to promote new ways to run CWL and WDL
   tools and workflows
-  UI rewrite
-  We're currently migrating our UI from AngularJS to Angular (2), watch
   for performance improvements and usability improvements in this area
-  Write API Web Service and Client!
-  With just a CWL descriptor and Dockerfile, this allows you to
   programmatically create GitHub and Quay.io repositories and then
   register and publish the tool on Dockstore in just 2 commands.
   Publishing tools on Dockstore has gotten a lot easier. See
   `GitHub <https://github.com/dockstore/write_api_service/>`__ for more
   info on how to use the Write API. See :doc:`this
   doc </getting-started/dockstore-tools>`
   for information on different ways to register tools on Dockstore and
   when to use this Write API.

As usual, we're open to suggestions. If you have one or if you spot a
bug, drop us a line on
`GitHub <https://github.com/dockstore/dockstore/issues>`__
