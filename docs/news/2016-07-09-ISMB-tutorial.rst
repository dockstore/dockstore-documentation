ISMB Tutorial
=============

As described at
`ISMB <http://www.iscb.org/cms_addon/conferences/ismb2016/akes.php>`__

    Dr. O’Connor will begin by discussing the ICGC PCAWG project and the
    insights he's gained from rapidly analyzing thousands of whole
    cancer genomes. Attendees will learn about how his team has used
    Docker as a key component to their workflow, best practices for
    creating shareable tools, as well as the motivation behind the
    creation of Dockstore (dockstore.org), a platform for sharing
    Docker­based tools described with the Common Workflow Language.
    Attendees will learn how to create custom Docker containers and push
    them to Dockstore to share with the community.
