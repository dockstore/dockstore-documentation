Breaking changes
----------------

Major
~~~~~

-  none intended

Minor
~~~~~

- while workflow launching should be unaffected, metadata editing through the 1.6.0 CLI will no longer function till an upgrade to the 1.7.0 CLI
- Improved parsing code and support for WDL 1.0 means that some previously invalid tools and workflows should now be valid (or vice versa)
  - A refresh of the tools and workflows is required to redo validation
- My Tools and My Workflows links are now in account dropdown
