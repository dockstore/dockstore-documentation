Breaking changes
----------------

Major
~~~~~

-  none known (or intended anyway)

Minor
~~~~~

-  while many workflows with file structures that previously did not
   work should be working with this update, a few workflows with nested
   file structures and were previously refreshed incorrectly may have
   issues with the migration
-  please refresh workflows that you notice may have issues or let us
   know (drop us a line on https://gitter.im/ga4gh/dockstore on github
   or on discourse) if you run into an issue where a workflow seems to
   have indexed a source file incorrectly in the wrong location, thanks!
