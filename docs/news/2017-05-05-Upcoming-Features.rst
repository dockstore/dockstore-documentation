Upcoming Features
=================

To give you a taste of what we're working on for the next major version
of Dockstore, we're looking at features in the following main areas:

-  Searching!
-  As Dockstore grows, we've noticed that our current solution for
   searching tools (go to `Tools <https://dockstore.org/tools>`__ or
   `Workflows <https://dockstore.org/workflows>`__ and type in the
   search box) is becoming less useful. Look for more useful ways to
   search and filter tools and workflows in the next version
-  More ways to launch tools and workflows
-  We're working with partners to promote new ways to run CWL and WDL
   tools and workflows
-  UI rewrite
-  We're currently migrating our UI from AngularJS to Angular (2), watch
   for performance improvements and usability improvements in this area
-  Write API Web Service and Client!
-  With just a CWL descriptor and Dockerfile, this allows you to
   programmatically create GitHub and Quay.io repositories and then
   register and publish the tool on Dockstore in just 2 commands.
   Publishing tools on Dockstore has gotten a lot easier. See
   `GitHub <https://github.com/dockstore/write_api_service/>`__ for more
   info on how to use the Write API. See :doc:`this
   doc </getting-started/dockstore-tools>`
   for information on different ways to register tools on Dockstore and
   when to use this Write API.

As usual, we're open to suggestions. If you have one or if you spot a
bug, drop us a line on
`GitHub <https://github.com/dockstore/dockstore/issues>`__

April 19, 2017 - Dockstore 1.2 Release
--------------------------------------

The latest Dockstore major release includes a large number of new
features and fixes. A subset of highlighted new features follows.

Highlighted New Features
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Support for private tools
-  users can register tools where users will need to ask the original
   author for access
-  Support for
   `private <https://dockstore.org/docs/docker_registries>`__ Docker
   images hosted in GitLab and Amazon ECR
-  Allow users to star tools and workflows
-  Stargazers page to show all users who have starred a particular tool
   or workflow
-  Support for `file provisioning
   plugins <https://github.com/dockstore/dockstore-cli/tree/master/dockstore-file-plugin-parent>`__
-  Better error messaging passed along from a newer cwltool version
-  Compatibility with a Write API service for programmatically adding
   tools

Breaking Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  The default Dockstore install no longer includes S3 support. Instead,
   S3 support is provided by a plugin that can be installed via
   ``dockstore plugin download``
-  The command ``dockstore tool launch`` used to use ``--local-entry``
   as a flag to indicate that ``--entry`` was pointing at a local file.
   Now, it replaces ``--entry``. i.e. use
   ``dockstore tool launch --local-entry <your local file>`` rather than
   ``dockstore tool launch --local-entry --entry <your local file>``
-  Update your cwltool install, details in the onboarding wizard
