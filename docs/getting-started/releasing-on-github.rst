At this point, we've successfully created our tool in Docker, tested it,
written a workflow language descriptor that describes how to run it, and
tested running this via the Dockstore command line. All of this work has
been done locally; so if we encounter problems along the way, it is fast
to perform debug cycles. At this point, we're confident that the tool is
bug free and ready to share with others. It's time to release
``1.25-6_1.1``

Releasing will tag your GitHub repository with a version tag so you can
always get back to this particular release. I'm going to use the tag
``1.25-6_1.1`` which I'll need to update the Docker image tag in
my CWL/WDL/Nextflow file. Note that if you're following the tutorial
using a forked version of the bamstats repo, your organization name
should be different. GitHub makes it very easy to release:

I click on "releases" in my forked version of the GitHub project
`page <https://github.com/CancerCollaboratory/dockstore-tool-bamstats>`__
and then follow the directions to create a new release. Simple as that!
