Dockstore 1.2.5
===============

Visit our `new forum <https://discuss.dockstore.org/>`__. Discuss tools,
tooling, bioinformatics cloud computing, etc. This will replace both the
private OICR-based mailing list and the Disqus integration that we've
been using to provide discussion and commenting on tools respectively.

Additionally, our hotfix release (with a few hidden features to be
formally released later) includes fixes for the following:

-  File provisioning changes to support GA4GH-DREAM workflows including
   whole directory provision
-  Fixes for workflow parameter json creation and CWL download
-  Several file provisioning fixes based on user feedback
-  Issues saving workflow test json files

Breaking Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  We needed to clear out unpublished workflows to do some clean-up. Let
   us know if you had anything important stored in unpublished as
   opposed to published workflows.
-  Potentially breaking, if a destination is not specified for a
   particular file, by default we will provision it to the current
   working directory after a warning

`GitHub <https://github.com/dockstore/dockstore/milestone/12>`__.
