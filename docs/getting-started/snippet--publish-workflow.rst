After you have successfully added your workflow onto Dockstore and have it
synced with GitHub, Bitbucket, or GitLab, you are now ready to share your
workflow with the public! Assuming that your workflow has at least one valid
version, you can publish your workflow for everyone to use. Simply select the
workflow on the ``/my-workflows`` page and click publish.
