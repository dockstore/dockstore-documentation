# Attic

This dusty room houses the following:

* Outdated documentation pages
* Materials used for generating images or tables
* A script for generating the glossary

There's nothing particularly secret in here, but nothing in this folder (including this readme) should be directly rendered as-is on docs.dockstore.org, although the files/images they generate might be.
