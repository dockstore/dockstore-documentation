ORCIDs in Dockstore
============================

Have an ORCID_? You can now connect it to your Dockstore account.

.. _ORCID: https://orcid.org/)

Linking your ORCID to your Dockstore account
--------------------------------------------

The process is quite simple. If you are logged in now, you can `click here`_ to get there, or choose "Account" from the dropdown menu on the top right where your username is displayed. This will take you to a tab where you can control your linked services, such as Github and Quay. One of those, towards the bottom of the list, is the ability to link your account with ORCID.

Now that your account is linked, when someone views an organization page of which you are a member, your ORCID will show up, helping connect your work on Dockstore with all of your other scientific contributions.

You can also see the ORCID of members who have starred a workflow or tool. If you press the number next to the star button in the top right of a tool, you will see a list of stargazers. Stargazers with an ORCID will have that ORCID displayed.
