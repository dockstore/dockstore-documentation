Three new workflows used to generate the `ICGC PanCancer Analysis of
Whole Genomes (PCAWG) <https://dcc.icgc.org/icgc-in-the-cloud/aws>`__
dataset have been released and validated with CWL 1.0.

These are:

* `DELLY <https://dockstore.org/containers/quay.io/pancancer/pcawg_delly_workflow>`_ structural variation
* `Sanger <https://dockstore.org/containers/quay.io/pancancer/pcawg-sanger-cgp-workflow>`_ somatic calling
* `DKFZ <https://dockstore.org/containers/quay.io/pancancer/pcawg-dkfz-workflow>`_ SNVs, indels, copy number

These workflows join the first workflow used to generate this dataset,
`BWA-mem <https://dockstore.org/containers/quay.io/pancancer/pcawg-bwa-mem-workflow>`__.

Highlighted New Features
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Support for the preliminary GA4GH `tool-registry-schema
   1.0 <https://github.com/ga4gh/tool-registry-schemas>`__ will allow
   Dockstore to share and exchange tools with other similar projects
   around the world
-  Upgraded support for CWL 1.0 (previously draft-3) allows Dockstore to
   display and launch tools
-  Dockstore launcher (which allows you to run tools locally on one
   host) supports file provisioning based on `CWL secondary
   files <http://www.commonwl.org/v1.0/CommandLineTool.html#CommandInputParameter>`__.
   See
   `Sanger <https://github.com/ICGC-TCGA-PanCancer/CGP-Somatic-Docker/blob/develop/Dockstore.cwl>`__
   for an example
-  Default branch/tag support allows tool developers to pin a particular
   version of their tool to display to their users
