--------------

-  Archiving an entry
-  Unarchiving an entry

This tutorial walks through the process of archiving entries from Dockstore.

This action will make your entry read-only and less prominent in the Dockstore user interface.
You can unarchive your entry back to normal at any time.


Specific Changes When Archived
-------------------------

After you archive the Dockstore workflow, it will be:

- Marked as "Archived".
- Read-only, except to unarchive. GitHub updates will be ignored.
- Ranked lower in Dockstore Search.
- Displayed in the "Archived" section of your Dockstore dashboard.

Archiving an Entry
