Dockstore 1.3.0
===============

We've just released the next major version of Dockstore!

Highlighted new features include a:

* search interface for quickly locating tools by keyword, author, labels, organization, etc.
* search niceties such as search term autocomplete, an advanced search, and a tag cloud highlighting significant terms
* updates for our CLI development environment to use cwltool 1.0.20170828135420 and cromwell 29.
* our deployment environment is now fully described by `Docker Compose <https://github.com/dockstore/compose_setup>`_ allowing developers to spin up a private version of Dockstore including 1.3.0, 1.2.10, and search
* integration with https://discuss.dockstore.org/
* user requests such as the ability to allow for more exotic Dockerfile names and a reorganized tutorial for users of tools and workflows (as opposed to tool and workflow developers)
* and a bit of inside baseball, we migrated from Angular 1 to Angular 4 as a foundation for future improvements
