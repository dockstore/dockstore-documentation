Write-API Conversion Process
============================

This is a service aimed at two tasks

1. Providing a concrete reference implementation of a proposed GA4GH
   Write API.
2. Providing a utility for developers to convert plain CWL/WDL files and
   Dockerfiles into GitHub repos storing those plain CWL/WDL files and
   Quay.io repos storing Docker images built from those Dockerfiles.
   This can be used by those converting tools described in other formats
   into "Dockstore-friendly" tools that can be quickly registered and
   published in Dockstore by using the Write API Client's publish
   command or programmatically via the Dockstore API. It is an
   alternative to using a GUI to register tools on Dockstore.

This is intended to be used by:

-  Tool Migrators - Developers that have access to a large number of
   tools in some different format and wants to migrate them all
   programmatically to Dockstore with minimal effort.

-  Tool Developers - Developers of tools that wants a quick and simple
   way of creating one without spending a large amount of time to post a
   single Dockerfile and CWL descriptor to implement each tool.

Building/Downloading the API jars
---------------------------------

You have the option to either build or download the API jars.

Build
~~~~~

::

    git clone https://github.com/dockstore/write_api_service.git
    cd write_api_service
    mvn clean install -DskipTests

The built jars will be available as:

``write-api-service/target/write-api-service*.jar``

``write-api-client/target/write-api-client*shaded.jar``

Download
~~~~~~~~

Additionally, you can download the Write API jars using the following:

::

    wget https://artifacts.oicr.on.ca/artifactory/collab-release/io/dockstore/write-api-client/1.0.2/write-api-client-1.0.2-shaded.jar
    wget https://artifacts.oicr.on.ca/artifactory/collab-release/io/dockstore/write-api-service/1.0.2/write-api-service-1.0.2.jar

Note that the client one is a shaded jar.

Web Service Prerequisites
-------------------------

-  GitHub token - Learn how to create tokens on GitHub here. You will
   need the scope "repo".

-  GitHub organization(s) - Your GitHub token must have access to at
   least one existing GitHub organization. The organization can be
   changed as long as the the GitHub token still has access to it. The
   Write API web service currently does not create GitHub organizations.
   The name of this organization must match the Quay.io organization.
   This organization will contain the repository that will be created.

-  Quay.io organization and Quay.io token

   You will need an existing Quay.io organization. The Write API
   currently does not create Quay.io organizations. The name of this
   organization must match the GitHub organization. Once you have an
   organization, a token must be created for it.

   This organization will contain the repository that will be created.
   Changing the Quay.io organization requires the token to be
   recreated/changed too.

   Learn how to create a token on Quay.io for your organizations here
   under the heading "Generating a Token (for internal application
   use)". You will need to provide these permissions:

   -  Create Repositories

   -  View all visible repositories

   -  Read/Write to any accessible repository

Server Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The web service alone only requires a GitHub and Quay.io token. There
are two ways to specify your tokens.

-  Environmental variables. You can set them in Bash like the following:

   ::

       export quayioToken=<your token here>
       export githubToken=<your token here>

-  The YAML configuration file. The tokens can be entered in the top two
   lines. An example of a YAML configuration file can be seen
   `here <https://github.com/dockstore/write_api_service/blob/develop/write-api-service/src/main/resources/example.yml>`__.

Run the service using a configuration file:
``java -jar write-api-service-*.jar server example.yml`` The example.yml
shown previously uses port 8082 by default, this can be changed. Note
this port number, it will later be used for the Write API Client
properties file.

After running the webservice, you can check out the web service
endpoints through swagger. By default, it is available at
``http://localhost:8082/static/swagger-ui/index.html``.

The basic workflow is that GitHub repos are created when posting a new
tool. When files are posted or put to a version of a tool, we will
create or delete and re-create a GitHub release/branch/tag with a
matching name. When Dockerfiles are added, the tool will be created and
built as a Quay.io repo. After adding both Dockerfiles and descriptors,
you basically have a tool that is ready to be quickly registered and
published under the Dockstore web service. Go to Dockstore, do a
refresh, and then hit quick register on the repos that you wish to
publish. You can also do this programmatically through the write api
client

Client Prerequisites
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Write API web service and all its prerequisites

By now, then web service should be up and running with valid GitHub and
Quay.io tokens. If not, please return to the web service usage section
to get that running first. It is advised to ensure that the Write API
web service is functioning correctly before using the client.

-  :doc:`Dockstore token </getting-started/register-on-dockstore>`

Follow the "Getting Started with Dockstore" tutorial to get a Dockstore
token. Note this down, it will later be used in the Write API client
properties file.

-  Dockstore server-url

The Dockstore tutorial earlier would've specified the server-url
alongside the token. Unless you're running your own dockstore
webservice, the Dockstore production server-url is
``https://www.dockstore.org/api``. Note this down as it will be used later
in the Write API client properties file.

-  Quay.io integration

In order to publish to Dockstore, Quay.io must be linked to Dockstore.
See
:ref:`Dockstore <linking-with-external-services>`
on how to link your Quay.io account to Dockstore.

-  Write API web service URL

You will need to know the URL of the Write API web service you ran
previously. If you've been using the example.yml, it should be
``http://localhost:8082/api/ga4gh/v1``

Client Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The configuration file used by the write-api-client is located at
~/.dockstore/write.api.config.properties It should look something like
this:

::

    dockstoreToken=abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz1234567890
    server-url=https://www.dockstore.org/api
    organization=test_organization
    repo=test_repository
    write-api-url=http://localhost:8080/api/ga4gh/v1

"dockstoreToken" is acquired from your account page on the dockstore
website . "server-url" is the dockstore server url. "organization" is
the organization/user of the repository to create. "repo" is the
repository to create. "write-api-url" is the url of the
write-api-service

Sample Client Output
--------------------

::

    client add --Dockerfile Dockerfile --cwl-file Dockstore.cwl --cwl-secondary-file Dockstore2.cwl --version 3.0
    {
      "githubURL": "https://github.com/dockstore-testing/test_repo3",
      "quayioURL": "https://quay.io/repository/dockstore-testing/test_repo3",
      "version": "3.0"
    }

You can pipe the output like this:

::

    client add --Dockerfile Dockerfile --cwl-file Dockstore.cwl --cwl-secondary-file Dockstore2.cwl --version 3.0 > test.json

and then:

::

    client publish --tool test.json
