AnVIL
=====

    For Dockstore 1.8.0+

Dockstore integrates with the `Analysis, Visualization, and Informatics Lab-space (AnVIL) <https://www.genome.gov/Funded-Programs-Projects/Computational-Genomics-and-Data-Science-Program/Genomic-Analysis-Visualization-Informatics-Lab-space-AnVIL>`__ platform,
allowing you to launch WDL-based workflows from Dockstore in AnVIL. Here is some information on
what that looks like from a user point of view in a mini-tutorial.

Exporting into AnVIL
--------------------

When browsing WDL workflows from within Dockstore, you will see a
"Launch with AnVIL" button on the right. The currently selected version
of the workflow will be exported.

If not logged into AnVIL, you will be prompted to login. Otherwise, or
after login, you will be presented with the following screen.

You will need to pick a workspace to export it into. You can either
select an existing workspace or create a new one.

Then hit the "Import" button and continue from within the Terra
interface to configure and run your workflow.

Note that you may want to double-check that the workflow specifies a
runtime environment (docker, cpu, memory, and disks) to avoid using
limiting defaults on AnVIL. See more
`here <https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/stable/wf_options/Overview>`__.

Limitations
-----------

1. While we support launching of WDL workflows, tools as listed in
   Dockstore are currently not supported.
2. AnVIL does not currently support file-path based imports. Importing a
   workflow with file-based imports will result in error. See the
   `converting file-based imports
   doc <../end-user-topics/language-support.html#converting-file-path-based-imports-to-public-http-s-based-imports-for-wdl>`__
   for more info.
3. Only the WDL language is supported.
