User Created Projects
---------------------

Of course, the Dockstore team is not the only ones that write code or
documentation to work with CWL tools and Dockstore. Here we list some
user-created projects that make it easier to work with Dockstore in
various ways

`cgp-dockstore <https://github.com/cancerit/cgp-dockstore>`__
-------------------------------------------------------------

Out of the Cancer Genome Project at the Wellcome Trust, Sanger
Institute, this project makes it easier for users that are familiar with
`Packer <https://www.packer.io/>`__ to work with tools and images
registered on Dockstore on OpenStack.

`PCAWG-Docker-Test <https://github.com/ICGC-TCGA-PanCancer/PCAWG-Docker-Test>`__
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Miguel Vazquez has been leading the docktesters group. This is a group
that is in charge of testing the
`PCAWG <https://icgc.org/working-pancancer-data-aws>`__\ (PanCancer
Analysis of Whole Genomes) tools and workflows. As a part of this work
he created a series of scripts (linked above) that demonstrate how to
get data and run through all of the PCAWG analysis in sequence.

`Alignment pipeline tutorial for the Pan Prostate project <https://docs.google.com/document/d/1djQ-8YlqfjbOJRnkeCu7lV1he_vJygIXn4ExHz6m874/edit?usp=sharing>`__
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Tutorials and documentation are always appreciated as well! The
following tutorial demonstrates how to run the Pan Prostate pipeline and
how to work with Dockstore tools (normally using Docker images) using
Singularity.

`pfda2dockstore <https://github.com/OpenGenomics/pfda2dockstore/tree/wrapup>`__
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A utility that exports precisionFDA apps to Dockstore, creating
Dockstore tools complete with Dockerfiles and CWL descriptors.

`Run Dockstore apps on the (Seven Bridges) platform <https://docs.cancergenomicscloud.org/docs/run-dockstore-apps-on-the-cgc>`__
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A tutorial on how to export CWL tools from Dockstore and run them in the
SevenBridges platform.

Use Case Posters
----------------

As Dockstore gains traction people are showing how they are using it in
posters for various conferences. Feel free to create a fork and add
yours.
