Overview of Checker Workflows
-----------------------------

Checker workflows are additional workflows you can associate with a tool
or workflow. The purpose of them is to ensure that a tool or workflow,
given some inputs, produces the expected outputs on a platform different
from the one where you are developing.

In the near future, checker workflows can be used for iterations of the
GA4GH-DREAM challenge. In the long-term, they can picked up and run by
the automated GA4GH workflow "testbed" to test your workflows across a
variety of workflow platforms. See this
`presentation <https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1VXdReGYXayzO7Jr-9XaLHNv6Wt46CwfvkfFDR8OEgJM/edit?usp=sharing>`__
for more details and contact the GA4GH Cloud Work Stream for more
information on contributing to the workflow testbed or related APIs.

Below is a visual overview of how a checker workflow looks.

   Checker Workflow Layout

The term "entry" will be used as a generic term to refer to both tools
and workflows.

The entry that a checker workflow is testing will be referred to as an
original tool/workflow/entry.

For this tutorial we will be registering a checker workflow to test an
original tool that calculates the MD5sum of a file.

The relevant tools and workflows for both CWL and WDL can be found in the following Git
repository: https://github.com/dockstore-testing/md5sum-checker

The following sections will use CWL in its examples. The same instructions apply equally to WDL. This table contains the WDL equivalents:

+-----------------------------+-------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------+
| File Type                   | CWL                                 | WDL                                     |
+=============================+=====================================+=========================================+
| Tool input parameter        | /md5sum/md5sum-input-cwl.json       | /md5sum/md5sum-wdl.json                 |
+-----------------------------+-------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------+
| Checker input parameter     | /checker-input-cwl.json             | /md5sum-wdl.json                        |
+-----------------------------+-------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------+
| Tool descriptor             | /md5sum/md5sum-tool.cwl             | /md5sum/md5sum-workflow.wdl             |
+-----------------------------+-------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------+
| Checker-wrapping descriptor | /checker-workflow-wrapping-tool.cwl | /checker-workflow-wrapping-workflow.wdl |
+-----------------------------+-------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------+
| Checker descriptor          | /checker/md5sum-checker.cwl         | /checker/md5sum-checker.wdl             |
+-----------------------------+-------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------+

Quick overview of structure
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Like regular workflows, a checker workflow can describe an example input
from an input parameter file. The checker workflow can either use the
input parameter file for the original entry, or it can define its own.
The second case is useful when the validation tool/workflow has some
extra parameters not required by the original entry.

For our example the second case is used. The original tool has the input
parameter file
`/md5sum-input-cwl.json <https://github.com/dockstore-testing/md5sum-checker/blob/master/md5sum/md5sum-input-cwl.json>`__.
This is the file that runs a particular example with the original tool.

::

    {
      "input_file": {
            "class": "File",
            "path": "../md5sum.input"
        }
    }

The checker workflow has the input parameter file
`/checker-input-cwl.json <https://github.com/dockstore-testing/md5sum-checker/blob/master/checker-input-cwl.json>`__.
This is the file that we would pass to the checker workflow to ensure
that our original tool is working properly when we run it with the input
file mentioned above. Again, in some cases this file could be the same
as the one for the original tool parameter file, though not in this
case.

::

    {
      "input_file": {
            "class": "File",
            "path": "md5sum.input"
        },
        "expected_md5": "00579a00e3e7fa0674428ac7049423e2"
    }

Notice that the checker parameter file has the same content as the
original parameter file, in addition to having a checker specific
parameter.

One point of confusion is that a checker workflow contains a validation
tool/workflow. The validation tool/workflow is what does the bulk of the
validation. It is responsible for ensuring that the results of the
original entry match expected results. The checker workflow refers to
the workflow that connects the original entry with the validation
tool/workflow, so that it can be run as one workflow.

Output of checker workflow
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To ensure that checking a checker workflow's output can be automated, it
is important that the checker workflow produce consistent exit codes. We
require using an exit code of 0 for success and an exit code of not 0
for failures.

We also recommend producing the following two output files containing
the stdout and stderr respectively:

* log.stdout
* log.stderr

Note on CLI usage
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For existing dockstore commands (tools and workflows), entry refers to
the path of a specific tool or workflow. For checker workflows, entry
refers to the path of the original entry. It does not refer to the
checker workflow's path.

Adding a checker workflow
-------------------------

Currently, you can add checker workflows to existing tools and workflows
through the UI and CLI

From the UI
~~~~~~~~~~~

Lets add a checker workflow for the tool described by
`/md5sum/md5sum-tool.cwl <https://github.com/dockstore-testing/md5sum-checker/blob/master/md5sum/md5sum-tool.cwl>`__
in the git repository. I already have the tool properly setup on
Dockstore. For this tutorial it is assumed that you are familiar with
the process for setting up tools and workflows on Dockstore.

The first step is to find the tool under the my tools page. In the info
tab there is an option to add a checker workflow. Click on the add
button.

.. figure:: /assets/images/docs/checker-workflow-add.png
   :alt: Checker Workflow Add

   Checker Workflow Add

When registering a checker workflow, you need the following fields:

* Default checker workflow path (path to main descriptor of the checker workflow)
* Default test parameter file (if not given will copy over from original entry)
* Descriptor type (CWL or WDL) when original entry is a tool

.. figure:: /assets/images/docs/checker-workflow-register.png
   :alt: Checker Workflow Register

   Checker Workflow Register

Once a checker workflow has been added, you can view it by going to the
info tab of the original entry. Where there used to be an add button,
there is now the view button. View will take you back to your checker
workflow page.

From the CLI
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Run the command ``dockstore checker --help`` to see all available
checker workflow commands. For now we are interested in the add command.

Using our example checker workflow, we would run the following:

``dockstore checker add --entry quay.io/natalieeo/md5sum-checker --descriptor-type cwl --descriptor-path /checker-workflow-wrapping-tool.cwl --input-parameter-path /checker-input-cwl.json``

This will add the checker workflow defined by
`/checker-workflow-wrapping-tool.cwl <https://github.com/dockstore-testing/md5sum-checker/blob/master/checker-workflow-wrapping-tool.cwl>`__
to the entry ``quay.io/natalieeo/md5sum-checker``.

The descriptor type will default to 'CWL' if none is provided. The
default input parameter path will default to the default input parameter
path of the original entry.

Updating a checker workflow
---------------------------

From the UI
~~~~~~~~~~~

Updating a checker workflow and associated versions can be done the same
way as with normal workflows. The only difference is that to get to the
correct page in My Workflows you must go through the original tool or
workflow, in My Tools and My Workflows respectively.

From the CLI
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Updating a checker workflow can be done the same way as updating a
normal workflow, though there are fewer options.

You can update the default test parameter path and the default
descriptor path. Run ``dockstore checker update --help`` for more
information.

Lets update the default descriptor path in our example to a new value.
``dockstore checker update --entry quay.io/natalieeo/md5sum-checker --default-descriptor-path /checker-workflow-wrapping-tool.cwl``

This will update the default descriptor path for the checker workflow.
Although in this example, the path is already properly set.

Updating versions of a checker workflow is also quite similar to
updating versions of a workflow, but again, there are fewer options. Run
``dockstore checker update_version --help`` for more information.

We can update the master version of our example checker workflow to be
hidden by running
``dockstore checker update_version --entry quay.io/natalieeo/md5sum-checker --name master --hidden true``

Adding/Removing test input parameter files for a version
--------------------------------------------------------

From the UI
~~~~~~~~~~~

Updating the test input parameter files associated with a checker
workflow version can be done the same way as with normal workflows. The
only difference is that to get to the correct page in My Workflows you
must go through the original tool or workflow, in My Tools and My
Workflows respectively.

From the CLI
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Like most commands, adding/removing test input parameter files to a
checker workflow version can be done in a similar fashion to normal
workflows. No functionality is lost for this command. Run
``dockstore checker test_parameter --help`` for more information.

``dockstore checker test_parameter --entry quay.io/natalieeo/md5sum-checker --version master --add /checker-input-cwl.json``

This will add the test parameter file
`/checker-input-cwl.json <https://github.com/dockstore-testing/md5sum-checker/blob/master/checker-input-cwl.json>`__
to the master version of the checker workflow. Though in our example we
already added it when we added the checker workflow, so nothing will
happen.

Launching a checker workflow
----------------------------

From the CLI
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Launching a checker workflow from the CLI should feel very familiar if
you have launched tools or workflows on the CLI. You launch it the same
as any other entry, however you use the checker mode.

Below is an example of launching a checker workflow for our md5sum
example.

``dockstore checker launch --entry quay.io/natalieeo/md5sum-checker:master --json test.json``

In this example, test.json is a local version of the following file:
`/checker-input-cwl.json <https://github.com/dockstore-testing/md5sum-checker/blob/master/checker-input-cwl.json>`__

We also need a local version of the file we are calculating the md5sum
for:
`/md5sum.input <https://github.com/dockstore-testing/md5sum-checker/blob/master/md5sum.input>`__

Downloading all relevant files for a checker workflow
-----------------------------------------------------

It can be useful to have all relevant files for a checker workflow
locally. This can be done with the download feature.

From the CLI
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The command for this is very simple. Again note that the entry is for
the original entry, and not the checker workflow.

``dockstore checker download --entry quay.io/natalieeo/md5sum-checker --version master``

This will download the descriptor and any secondary descriptors, while
maintaining the correct directory structure.

For Advanced Users
------------------

You can interact with checker workflows using TRS. See :doc:`Checker
Workflows and the TRS <checker-workflow-trs>` for more information.
