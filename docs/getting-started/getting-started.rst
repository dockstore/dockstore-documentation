    Mac users, make note of this :ref:`FAQ <how-do-i-use-the-dockstore-cli-on-a-mac>` entry if you run into errors while going through the developer tutorials.

Introduction
==================

An introduction to everything required to properly use Dockstore as a contributor. Learn
about how Docker and CWL/WDL/Nextflow are changing how scientists use
and create tools via a series of tutorials which goes through the whole
process of:

- Creating a tool with Docker
- Describing the tool with a descriptor file (CWL/WDL/Nextflow)
- Creating a Dockstore account
- Registering the tool on Dockstore

The tool we will be using throughout this tutorial is
`BAMStats <http://bamstats.sourceforge.net/>`__. It is a tool for
summarising Next Generation Sequencing alignments. It accepts a BAM file
as input and produces a ZIP file containing an HTML report on the alignment.
