Creating a Dockstore Account
============================

Tutorial Goals
--------------

-  Create a Dockstore account
-  Link to relevant third party services

Register on Dockstore
---------------------

Before you can publish your new tool, you need to create a Dockstore
account and link the relevant services. Dockstore supports login through
GitHub using OAuth2. You can register at the `login/register
page <https://dockstore.org/login>`__.

You can also login with your Google Account. This is required to use the
workflow sharing feature for users coming from Terra.

Dockstore usernames
-------------------

Your username will be visible in any public tool or workflow that you
have.

If you register with GitHub, we will default to your GitHub username. As
of 1.5.0, if you register with Google, we will default to the email
associated with your Google account.

Changing your username
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can change your username in the onboarding wizard during setup or
from the accounts page at the Dockstore Account Controls tab.

Currently you can only change your username when the following
conditions are true:

* You do not have any published tools or workflows
* You do not have anything shared by you to other users through the permissions tab for workflows

For Google users, your initial username will include an @ symbol. We
recommend you change your username to something that is not an email to
avoid unwanted email.

Linking With External Services
------------------------------

Once you register you can start linking your external accounts. There is
also a command line tool we will use for most of the tasks in this
tutorial. For this tutorial you only need to have your GitHub and
Quay.io accounts established. However, Dockstore supports the following
external services:

* GitHub
* Bitbucket
* GitLab
* Quay.io

Your link to GitHub is established on login and you will then be
prompted to link your other accounts.

If you registered with Google, you will also need to link your GitHub
account to follow along with the tutorial.

Below, GitHub, Google, and Quay.io accounts have been linked, it is
necessary for at least the GitHub account or the Google account be
linked in order to perform regular account activities.

Next Steps
----------

* Jump to the :doc:`workflow registration <dockstore-workflows/>` section if you are writing workflows,
  e.g. Nextflow or Galaxy
* Follow the :doc:`next tutorial <dockstore-tools/>` to register a tool on Dockstore. This wizard also
  also describes how to setup the ``dockstore`` command line tool after linking your accounts.

Upon completion you will be ready to use Dockstore.
