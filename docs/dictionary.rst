Further reading: `<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing>`_  



.. _dict collections:

collections
-----------
    A group of workflows or tools on Dockstore associated with a particular :ref:`dict organization`.  




.. _dict Common Workflow Language:

Common Workflow Language
------------------------
    A workflow language that describes how to run command-line tools. CWL is based on Java and can use Java commands within its own commands. :ref:`dict WDL` and CWL are relatively similar in principle, and code written in one language can often be translated into the other with some workarounds, but they are two different standards and each have unique features.  

see also :ref:`dict CWL`  

Further reading: `<https://www.commonwl.org/user_guide/>`_  



.. _dict container:

container
---------
    An emulated computer system that contains programs and their prerequisites, but does not contain the entire operating system. Unlike a :ref:`dict VM`, a container shares the same kernel as the host OS. A well known type of container is a :ref:`dict Docker container`.  




.. _dict Cromwell:

Cromwell
--------
    An open-source :ref:`dict WDL` executor managed by the Broad Institute. Cromwell is the default executor for the :ref:`dict Dockstore CLI` and is the executor used by :ref:`dict Terra`.  

.. note:: This term as we define it here is associated with Broad Institute and may have different definitions in other contexts.  

Further reading: `<https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>`_  



.. _dict CWL:

CWL
---
*abbreviation for* :ref:`dict Common Workflow Language`  




.. _dict DAG:

DAG
---
*abbreviation for* Directed Acyclic Graph  

    A directional graph like a flowchart that does not have any loops. On Dockstore we use DAGs to show the steps that a workflow takes.  

Further reading: `<https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ggdag/vignettes/intro-to-dags.html>`_  



.. _dict descriptor file:

descriptor file
---------------
    A file used to programmatically describe a tool or workflow. This file represents the instructions that will actually be executed. On Dockstore, we support .ga, .cwl, .wdl, and .nfl file extensions for :ref:`dict Galaxy`, :ref:`dict CWL`, :ref:`dict WDL`, and :ref:`dict Nextflow` respectively.  




.. _dict Docker:

Docker
------
pronounced "daw-ker", rhymes with walker  

    A program that can create "images" which are somewhat similar to virtual machines, as well as run those images. In the context of bioinformatics, this technology has two main benefits: First, a :ref:`dict Docker image` bundles up everything a given piece of software needs to run, meaning that someone who wants to run (for example) samtools via Docker only needs to install Docker, not samtools. Second, an instance of a Docker image is a relatively standardized environment even when running on different backends, meaning that two people running the same software in the same Docker image on two different computers are likely to get the exact same results. In other words, Docker is good for reproducibility and ease of use.  

Further reading: `<https://docker-curriculum.com/>`_  



.. _dict Docker container:

Docker container
----------------
    In order to actually use the software inside a :ref:`dict Docker image` using the `docker run` command, the Docker program creates a writable :ref:`dict layer` on top of the image, which leads to the creation of a :ref:`dict Docker container`. You can think of a Docker image as an unchanging template, and a Docker container as a writable instance generated from that template. A Docker image can exist on its own, but a Docker container requires a Docker image.  

Further reading: `<https://www.docker.com/resources/what-container/>`_  



.. _dict Docker image:

Docker image
------------
    A read-only file that represents a filesystem that contains some sort of code and that code's dependencies. A Docker image can be created using the `docker build` command in conjunction with a :ref:`dict Dockerfile`. If a workflow language references a Docker image, then the workflow executor will download that Docker image (unless was already downloaded previously) and add a writable layer onto the Docker image, which results in the creation of a :ref:`dict Docker container`.  




.. _dict Dockerfile:

Dockerfile
----------
    A file describing the creation of a :ref:`dict Docker image` by running commands that each form a :ref:`dict layer`.  

Further reading: `<https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/>`_  



.. _dict Dockstore CLI:

Dockstore CLI
-------------
*abbreviation for* Dockstore Command Line Interface  

    A command-line program developed by Dockstore. It is not required to use Dockstore, but it has many features to make running and developing workflows easier.  

see also :ref:`dict CLI`  

Further reading: `<https://docs.dockstore.org/en/stable/advanced-topics/dockstore-cli/dockstore-cli-faq.html>`_  



.. _dict Dockstore GitHub App:

Dockstore GitHub App
--------------------
    The GitHub App that allows for Dockstore to communicate with GitHub repositories.  

see also :ref:`dict GitHub App registration`  



.. _dict DOI:

DOI
---
*abbreviation for* Digital Object Identifier  

    An identifier that provides a long-lasting link to some sort of :ref:`dict immutable` digital object. On Dockstore, you can use Zenodo to mint a DOI of your workflows and tools to increase reproducibility.  




.. _dict DS-I Africa:

DS-I Africa
-----------
*abbreviation for* Data Science for health discovery and Innovation in Africa  

    An :ref:`dict NIH` initiative to leverage data science to address the African continent's public health needs.  

Further reading: `<https://commonfund.nih.gov/africadata>`_  



.. _dict EC2:

EC2
---
*abbreviation for* Elastic Compute Cloud  

    The cloud computing side of :ref:`dict AWS`. When running workflows on these backends, disk size will scale with your workflow requirements automatically. EC2 instances allow you to make use of Amazon's :ref:`dict spot instance` feature, which may reduce the cost of running workflows.  

Further reading: `<https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ec2/index.html>`_  



.. _dict egress:

egress
------
pronounced "ee-gress", rhymes with aggress  

    The action of leaving a place. In the context of :ref:`dict cloud computing`, an egress charge is a fee charged for downloading a file. Sometimes, the person hosting the file is charged for data egress. Other times, the person downloading the file is charged.  

.. note:: This term as we define it here is associated with cloud computing and may have different definitions in other contexts.  



.. _dict eLwazi:

eLwazi
------
pronounced "el-woz-ee", derived from the Xhosa word for knowledge (uLwazi) and the Luganda word for rock symbolizing robustness (Olwazi)  

    An African-lead open data science platform funded as part of the :ref:`dict NIH`'s :ref:`dict DS-I Africa` program. Leverages :ref:`dict Gen3`, :ref:`dict Terra`, and Dockstore.  

Further reading: `<https://elwazi.org/>`_  



.. _dict entry:

entry
-----
    A :ref:`dict tool` or :ref:`dict workflow` on Dockstore. A single entry on Dockstore has a description, a link to the original source-control repository, and at least one :ref:`dict descriptor file` which does some sort of computational task using :ref:`dict CWL`, :ref:`dict WDL`, :ref:`dict Nextflow`, or :ref:`dict Galaxy workflow` syntax. An entry can optionally include a :ref:`dict parameter file` that links to open-access test data. A single entry will include all versions of the tool or workflow that has been registered, with that versioning being based upon the versioning and branches of the source-control repository the descriptor file is hosted on (with the exception of a :ref:`dict legacy tool`, which have versioning based upon their Docker image tags), and any version can be pinned as the default. Entries can be added to :ref:`dict collections` associated with a particular :ref:`dict organization`, or added to :ref:`dict categories` so they can be grouped with other entries that have a similar scientific purpose. Entries may also have :ref:`dict labels` attached to them to help them be found via Dockstore's :ref:`dict faceted search` feature. If the entry is registered using the :ref:`dict Dockstore GitHub App`, then the entry will stay in sync automatically with the source-control repository. Additionally, if an entry is a valid :ref:`dict workflow`, any user can use our :ref:`dict launch with` feature to import the workflow to one of our cloud compute partners.  

.. note:: This term as we define it here is associated with Dockstore and may have different definitions in other contexts.  



.. _dict faceted search:

faceted search
--------------
    A type of search which allows users to narrow down their results based upon certain aspects of the things being searched. On Dockstore, our faceted search at <https://dockstore.org/search> allows users to narrow down their search to a particular workflow language, author, or other fields.  

Further reading: `<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faceted_search>`_  



.. _dict FAIR:

.. _dict GCP:

GCP
---
*abbreviation for* Google Cloud Platform  

    A backend used for cloud computing and cloud storage hosted by Google. :ref:`dict Terra` is an example of a system that runs on a GCP backend. When running workflows on these backends, make sure to account for the storage needed for your workflow, as GCP compute backends do not automatically scale their storage size at runtime. GCP backends allow you to make use of Google's :ref:`dict preemptible` feature, which may reduce the cost of running workflows.  

see also :ref:`dict EC2`  

Further reading: `<https://cloud.google.com/gcp>`_  



.. _dict Gen3:

----
    A data science platform affiliated with the University of Chicago. Hosts phenotypic and genotypic data for the :ref:`dict BD Catalyst`, :ref:`dict AnVIL Project`, :ref:`dict Kids First`, and :ref:`dict eLwazi` grants.  

Further reading: `<https://gen3.org/>`_  



.. _dict GitHub App registration:

GitHub App registration
-----------------------
    The recommended way to register a :ref:`dict tool` or :ref:`dict workflow` on Dockstore. This involves creating a :ref:`dict .dockstore.yml` file on the GitHub repository (other source-control methods are not supported) that hosts the tool or workflow, as well as installing the Dockstore GitHub App. This allows a Dockstore entry to remain in sync with the source-control repository automatically, including new branches, tagged commits, and releases created on GitHub after registration of the entry.  

.. note:: This term as we define it here is associated with Dockstore and may have different definitions in other contexts.  



.. _dict GitHub App tool:

.. _dict JSON:

JSON
----
pronounced "jason"  

*abbreviation for* JavaScript Object Notation  

    A human-readable file format that originated in JavaScript, but is now used by a variety of applications. Dockstore supports the inclusion of JSON and :ref:`dict YAML` files in entries to provide sample inputs for workflow and tool entries. Some workflow executors, such as :ref:`dict Cromwell`, can use these files to configure their inputs rather than having to manually listing every input when calling the workflow on the command line.  

see also :ref:`dict YAML`  

Further reading: `<https://www.json.org/json-en.html>`_  



.. _dict Jupyter:

Jupyter
-------
pronounced "Jupiter" like the planet  

    A project focused on developing "notebooks" for programming languages, most famously Python due to it starting as a splinter of iPython in the early 2010s, but including other languages as well such as R. Jupyter notebooks allow for blocks of code to be nestled between markdown text, allowing for easy documentation of the code blocks and reproducibility of analysis.  

Further reading: `<https://jupyter.org/>`_  



.. _dict kernel:

kernel
------
    An operating system's core program that is always loaded in memory, and modulates interactions between software and physical hardware, including but not limited to managing memory access for any program currently in RAM.  

Further reading: `<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_(operating_system)>`_  



.. _dict Kids First:

Further reading: `<https://docs.docker.com/storage/storagedriver/#images-and-layers>`_  



.. _dict legacy registration:

legacy registration
-------------------
    One of the two main ways of registering a :ref:`dict tool` or :ref:`dict workflow`. Legacy methods support a variety of source-control repositories, but new changes to the tool or workflow after registration will not be reflected on Dockstore until the maintainer of the Dockstore :ref:`dict entry` manually refreshes the tool or workflow in Dockstore's UI. For this reason, we generally recommend people use :ref:`dict GitHub App registration` instead.  

.. note:: This term as we define it here is associated with Dockstore and may have different definitions in other contexts.  



.. _dict legacy tool:

legacy tool
-----------
    On Dockstore, we use this term to refer to a :ref:`dict tool` that is registered using a :ref:`dict legacy registration` method. Legacy tools are not automatically synchronized with their source control repository, but can be updated manually by the tool maintainer. Additionally, legacy tools require a :ref:`dict Dockerfile` to be registered, and are versioned based on the tags of their associated :ref:`dict Docker image`. A legacy tool can be converted into a :ref:`dict GitHub App tool` via the following process: <https://docs.dockstore.org/en/stable/getting-started/github-apps/migrating-tools-to-github-apps.html>  

.. note:: This term as we define it here is associated with Dockstore and may have different definitions in other contexts.  



.. _dict legacy workflow:

legacy workflow
---------------
    On Dockstore, we use this term to refer to a :ref:`dict workflow` that is registered using a :ref:`dict legacy registration` method. Legacy workflows are not automatically synchronized with their source control repository, but can be updated manually by the workflow maintainer. A legacy workflow can be converted into a :ref:`dict GitHub App workflow` via the following process: <https://docs.dockstore.org/en/stable/getting-started/github-apps/migrating-workflows-to-github-apps.html>  

.. note:: This term as we define it here is associated with Dockstore and may have different definitions in other contexts.

Further reading: `<https://dockstore.org/organizations>`_  



.. _dict parameter file:

parameter file
--------------
    A :ref:`dict JSON` or :ref:`dict YAML` file that describes the inputs to a workflow. This usually includes internal links, or links to data in a Google or S3 bucket.  




.. _dict preemptible:

preemptible
-----------
    A type of :ref:`dict GCP` :ref:`dict VM` which may have its running jobs interrupted at any given time, and will be shut down if running for more than 24 hours. A preemptible machine is significantly cheaper than a standard VM, at the cost of possibly stopping before your computational work is finish. You can use preemptible machines when running workflows on GCP backends to save on compute costs.  

.. note:: This term as we define it here is associated with Google and may have different definitions in other contexts.

VM
--
*abbreviation for* virtual machine  

    An emulated computer system that runs on another computer system. Usually implies that an entire operating system(s) (the guest OS) is being run on top of another operating system (the host OS) via the host's hypervisor. The hypervisor manages the execution of processes of the guest operating system. This is in contrast to a :ref:`dict container`, which do not involve hypervisors nor run entire guest operating systems.

.. _dict Workflow Description Language:

Workflow Description Language
-----------------------------
    A workflow language managed by the Open WDL Project that is designed to describe command-line tools. Usually written as :ref:`dict WDL`. WDL and :ref:`dict CWL` are relatively similar in principle, and code written in one language can often be translated into the other with some workarounds, but they are two different standards and each have unique features.
