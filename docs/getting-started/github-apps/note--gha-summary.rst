.. note::
  Summary of GitHub App usage:

  #. :doc:`Install Dockstore GitHub App </getting-started/github-apps/snippet--installation>`
  #. Put a valid .dockstore.yml file into the top level of your repository
  #. Push a new commit with a .dockstore.yml file present
  #. Wait up to 5 minutes for Dockstore to process the new version
  #. See workflow on Dockstore

  Our docs sometimes use "GitHub App registration" and "registration with a .dockstore.yml file" interchangeably, as they are equivalent terms. The Dockstore GitHub App and a .dockstore.yml file are two components of the same registration method.
